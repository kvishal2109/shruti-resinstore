# Quick Solution: Manual Product Names

Since automatic extraction isn't working perfectly, here's the fastest way:

## Method 1: Just Tell Me the Names

Look at the website https://laxmisingla.catalog.to/ and tell me:

**Product 1:** [name]
**Product 2:** [name]
**Product 3:** [name]
**Product 4:** [name]
**Product 5:** [name]

I'll update the code immediately!

## Method 2: Use Simple Extractor

1. Open `extract-simple.js`
2. Copy all the code
3. Paste in browser console on the website
4. It will show all text - identify product names
5. Share the names with me

## Current Products (Need Names)

I already have:
- ✅ Product 1: Image URL ✅ Price: ₹573 ❌ Name: "Product 1" (needs update)
- ✅ Product 2: Image URL ✅ Price: ₹573 ❌ Name: "Product 2" (needs update)

Just tell me the 5 product names and I'll update them right away!
